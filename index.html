Furthermore, I hope to work in any company that encourages a great work-life balance, where I could work with smart, kind and understanding individuals that will help me be a better engineer as well as an individual overall!<br><br>
                                        <b>Long term:</b> My career goal is to use technology to innovate, raise quality of life, and build a better tomorrow. I seek to leverage my growing skillset to inspire change. In correspondence with my double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, I am motivated to innovate and provide value by answering the question: "how can this be done" across academia, entrepreneurship, and community service, I have routinely found myself asking this question. Curiosity, persistence, and a continual desire to learn are qualities that help me find answers, improve, and leverage my skills, and contribute meaningfully to those around me. That is mainly why I chose to pursue a career in the tech industry.

                                        Most kids inherit a similar eye color or a similar nose from their parents, however I've acquired much more than most, an energy for learning and a voracious curiosity which has ignited an entrepreneurial spirit within me at a young age. My dad, an engineer, told me to investigate the world with curious eyes, always seeking new adventures to learn. I watched him for a considerable length of time as he chipped away at elevator schematics, thinking about what all the different images and lines meant. I was interested in technology and needed to know how and why things worked the way they did. "How does this toaster work?" "what's inside the VCR?" <br><br>

                                        However, I was forever discontent with the streamlined answers that my parents provided me for these questions. So, I found responses for myself by investigating and testing, thus one test prompted another and, with every day my interest in math and science, in general, began to prosper. And question after question the fire within my young soul began to grow, and so I began to get involved in research programs and clubs at my high school. With these experiences, I was even more excited about what the world of math and science had to offer me, and so I took and finished the first three math courses of my engineering degree at the age of 16 in high school. Once I entered the University of Calgary, I began joining all the technical clubs that interested me and I continued to learn more and more about the science which initially fascinated me as a child.<br><br>

I learned to take advantage of the opportunities surrounding me. I was also encouraged to always present my best possible work at anything that I partook in.

                                        What intrigued me the most, was bridging the gap between how software and hardware communicate, and the architectural design that is required for a microcontroller to be a cohesive unit. Computer architecture acts as the interface between hardware and software. It deals with the components of a connection in a system. Computer Architecture helps us to understand the functionalities of a system. Computer Organization tells us how exactly all the units in the system are arranged and interconnected.This spoke to my previous experience in technical clubs at Schulich where we had multiple different sub-teams working on different aspects of the project, and how this division into subteams is really needed to make the full project come to life, as smoothly as possible.<br><br>

                                        <font size="+2"><b><em>What surprised me? What was the Relation to the inner workings of everyday objects?</em></b></font><br>
                                        While it seems necessary and obvious for the recent major shifts in technological advancements, the idea of pipelining and caching was the most intriguing to me. Delving deeper into the inner workings of the clever, and efficient, operation on multiple assembly instructions concurrently, while assuring the use of a minimum amount of cycles by storing urgent data closer to the CPU fascinated me as an individual who has always found fast algorithms appealing. Furthermore, the analogy to cookies and library books made these concepts of pipelining and caching even more real and accessible.<br><br>

                                        <font size="+2"><b><em>Application to personal Project/Experience</em></b> </font><br>
                                        In my previous involvement with SOAR satellite, I attempted to work on an stm32 to develop different functionalities for an on-board-computer for a nanosatellite. While working on this project, I had to write the most efficient code to save on the power that was used by the computer, and this was heavily talked about in encm369. We learned how simple C code was converted into assembly language code, and even machine language code. Learning about these details in class, allowed me to bridge some of the misconceptions that I had while working on this past project.<br>
                                        Additionally, looking at how organized and efficient the AVR was also impacted my personal views towards time-management. Seeing the optimization of the stages-of-execution put into perspective how much more I could potentially improve my time-management skills. However, there is a reason why humans are not robots, it is because we are not perfectly optimized to work as a computer does, and with that comes some of the time that we waste to aid with our mental-health, social-life, hobbies, etc.

                                        Over the past 2 years it seemed like my engineering degree was more abstract than I had thought, without any in-person or hands on experiences it seemed purely theoretical and not an “applied” science degree. However, with the implementation of the ILS kits and as well as the videos provided by Dr. Kartik on the usage of bench equipment, I am finally feeling like I am truly part of an engineering degree. During the past 2 years when times got tough academically I questioned my enrollment in the engineering degree, but with all of the hands-on experiences we are beginning to receive in ENEL 361 it is nothing but motivating and enriching the spark inside of me that initially interested me to pursue engineering.<br><br>

                                        I was quite shocked when I saw the harmony between how a diode, a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) were very much alike when represented in a physical and material perspective. Two sides of the same coin really. This catalyzed my critical thinking ability, as it showed me that there realistically are multiple ways to attack the same problems. And, while I thought science was a subject of pure axioms, where there is only one right answer, ENEL 361 proved this otherwise by convincing me that an engineer should sometimes get creative and visualize the solution in multiple forms instead of just one, as this helps with fully comprehending the applications,  as well as the limitations of a specific device.<br><br>

                                        This course delves into the finer details of how electrons navigate their way through different forms of semiconductors. You will learn about what diodes are, and how they could be used in different applications such as LEDs and solar cells. And, if you’re one for derivations and why equations are the way they are, then you will get a lot of that in this course. Be assured, you will walk in the path of electrons and completely see and understand why they operate in the way they do in semiconductors, through mathematical derivations and physical phenomena. Also, have you been hearing a lot of buzz about transistors and why they are the source of modern technology, well you also get a solid introduction to what and how transistors work under the hood.

                                        Learning and understanding why circuits and some electronics are delayed was quite enlightening, this was because most circuits acquire a parasitic resistor, capacitor, or inductor which could form some sort of RLC circuit. And, based on the transient and steady state responses of RLC circuits this all clicks in my mind very clearly now. This outreaches to the idea of inherent limitations that a design might face, and how to overcome these limitations by anticipating their occurrence in the planning phase of a project.
                                        <br>
                                        Furthermore, unfortunately, can never be able to completely eliminate parasitics. However, there are some simple layout choices one can make that will help reduce problems from parasitics. Selecting the right components can also prevent signal problems that arise from parasitic capacitance and inductance. Correspondingly, when it comes to the inherent design limitations for any project, one can always try to maximize performance by reducing limitations, however,  there will most-likely always be restrictions to the capabilities of a design to a certain degree of precision.

                                        As the incoming president for Schulich Ignite, project planning is on my mind consistently. What Schulich Ignite does is that it offers free introductory Python workshops to high school students where they are able to explore the fundamentals of coding in a fun and interactive environment. Furthermore, through my position for next year I am supposed to reintegrate the transition back to in-person sessions, as COVID begins to fade.

                                        What was mind boggling to me is how useful the Laplace transform is, while it seemed very abstract and obsolete as to why we were learning about it in Math 375 everything made sense as soon as we reached module 7(Laplace analysis of Circuits) of ENEL 343. The pure ingenuity to transform all circuit elements into the s domain then inverse the resultant to get a proper transfer function in the time domain was a surprise, to say the least. Furthermore, with the help of the derivation of these transfer functions we later learned about how they could be manipulated to create all types of different filters with different use cases, which are basically utilized everywhere in the world of signals, like in networks and communications.<br><br>

                                        Most recently, we have tried to implement a bandpass filter and an amplifier onto our ENEL 300 final project, using a combination of  a passive RC low-pass filter, a passive RC high-pass filter, and an inverting amplifier. We hope to use this high-pass filter to remove any dc voltage offset from our input signal that will be received from our guitar. Then, the low-pass filter will cut-out the audio frequency that is played by our speaker. Next, the non-inverting amplifier will attempt to provide a gain of about 100 to our input signal, which will be passed on to our AVR for further ADC sampling, and DAC feedback. Lastly, after the computation is finished on the microcontroller we will output visual and sound feedback to the user to assist with their tuning process. Therefore, without the presence of the amplifier and filter on our device none of the later steps would be possible.

                                        Students often think scrum and agile are the same thing because scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, scrum is a framework for getting work done, whereas agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to the customers’ needs. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.<br>
                                        The scrum framework is heuristic; it’s based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve. Lastly, after every sprint a retrospective is held to cover the goods and bads that need to be encouraged and fixed for later iterations.<br><br>

                                        When it comes to the agile process the most difficult aspect is not what I needed to learn, but what I needed to unlearn. I needed to unlearn previous beliefs and the behaviors that are rooted in those beliefs. For example:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Unlearn the belief that work can be specified up front. Instead learn that needs emerge, evolve and change.</li>
                                            <li>Unlearn the idea that work can be planned in advance. Learn that work is planned, reviewed, and replanned with blinkers on so we only look at the near future.</li>
                                            <li>Unlearn that estimates should be praised and schedules are the source of truth and light. Learn that estimates are just estimated, not commitments, and schedule/plan for slack-time.</li>
                                            <li>Unlearn that “that's the way we do it around here, you can’t change the system”. Learn that if things are going to get better, then things have to change around here.</li>
                                            <li>Unlearn that you should work on a deliverable until it’s finished, and then report back. Learn that daily standups are essential to the cohesive progress of a project.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>

                                        As second year students, at the beginning of the semester we were completely and utterly clueless regarding how to go on about creating a useful and doable project within 3 months. However, The central theme of Agile is flexibility. So, when we learned new materials from other concurrent courses, and realized how unrealistic some functionalities of our product were, we were responsive to change, even at the last minute, and adapted to it without much disruption. Also, because project deliverables were not set in stone, we were easily capable of reassessing our plans and adjusting our priorities to align with updated goals. Being adaptable means we could deliver consistently and manage clients’ changing requirements(user-stories) effectively. Because of Agile’s methodology to continuously iterate and improve, meaning processes were improved upon each time an interval is repeated, our team was more and more motivated through the period of the semester as we got closer and closer to achieving a minimal viable product. This consistent focus on improvement and quality control is one of the core principles of Agile, and it helped us to create our final working tuner device.

                                        <font size="+2"><b><em>My Biggest Takeaway</em></b></font><br>

                                        I learned what isn’t a retrospective: An agile retrospective is mainly run for the team to discuss what went well and what didn't during the past sprint. It must be kept only for the involved team so everyone feels comfortable to share their perspective. Project retrospectives are an important component of healthily functioning teams. In order to fully benefit from retrospectives, you should keep in mind some limitations and guidelines:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Retrospectives do not replace communication or actions taken to fix team or project issues at the time of occurrence.</li>
                                            <li>Retrospectives are not an excuse to spend an hour complaining (although it is important to let some venting happen during the session).</li>
                                            <li>Don’t turn the retrospective into a witch hunt. Retrospectives are not an opportunity to lecture your team on what they could have done better. Ideally, you would be proactively coaching your team throughout the project.</li>
                                            <li>Retrospectives should not be a huge burden on your time and resources. Throughout the 4 sprints, I found 10 to 15 minutes for reflection was sufficient. This gives everyone ample time to discuss each of the broad themes we’ll cover later in our assignment of user-stories and product-backlogs. This also forces people to be wise with the time they have during the retrospective.</li>
                                            <li>If some team members feel depressed or unsatisfied because of some practices, give them space to let these feelings out. Discuss them rationally instead of denying them. Don't let the negative attitude control the meeting either: Try to find what causes those emotions and work on it.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        The scrum framework itself is simple. The rules, artifacts, events, and roles are easy to understand. Its semi-prescriptive approach actually helps remove the ambiguities in the development process, while giving sufficient space for teams to introduce their individual flavor to it.<br>
                                        The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects. Also, the clear demarcation of roles and planned events ensure that there is transparency and collective ownership throughout the development cycle. Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time. <br>
                                        However, scrum could take time to fully understand, especially if the development team is acclimatized to a typical waterfall model. The concepts of smaller iterations, daily scrum meetings, sprint reviews, and identifying a scrum master could be a challenging cultural shift for a new team.<br>
                                        But, the long-term benefits far outweigh the initial learning curve. Scrum’s success in developing complex hardware and software products across diverse industries and verticals makes it a compelling framework to adopt in any project.<br><br>

                                        A deep understanding of a target audience is fundamental to creating exceptional products. User personas helped our team find the answer to one of our most important questions, “Who are we designing for?” By understanding the expectations, concerns, and motivations of target users, it made it possible to design a product that satisfies the users’ needs and therefore is successful. The first step to identifying the user’s needs is empathizing with them. Empathy is a core value if a team wants to make something that is good for the people who are going to use it. Personas enabled us to create an understanding and empathize with the end-users, guitar owners:<br>

                                            <li><b>Gaining a perspective similar to the user.</b> Creating user personas allowed us to step out of ourselves and recognize that different people have different needs and expectations. By thinking about the needs of a fictional persona, we were better able to infer what a real person might need.</li>
                                            <li><b>Identify with the user that the product is designed for.</b> The more we engaged with the user personas and saw them as real people, the more closely we considered them during the design process and wanted to create the best product for them.</li>
                                        </ul><br>

                                        According to research conducted by Accenture, Over the past five years, there has been a 71% rise in online searches for sustainable goods globally, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit. Consumers are engaging with sustainable businesses in ways that they previously ignored. This trend isn't just in first-world countries. Consumer satisfaction in developing and emerging economies is also tied to concerns around climate change, and many want businesses to commit to protecting nature and natural systems. In ENEL 300 we discussed the usage of cards and categories of sustainability to better optimize our designs for sustainability(https://sustainabledesigncards.dk/cards-and-categories/):<br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Maintenance:</b> By reducing the amount visits for maintenance of a product, then we can reduce the energy consumption that is carried out during each maintenance session.</li>
                                            <li><b>Modularity/Design for Disassembly:</b> designing a modular product, such that the product doesn't completely rely on the lifespan of one specific component. Modular products contain separable parts (modules) that can be replaced or upgraded individually by the user. By implementing this, we could support the functional lifespan and overall product longevity through the replacement of faulty components, instead of a completely new purchase. Also, This will further enhance the users’ emotional attachment thanks to modules that adapt to the users’ specific needs.</li>
                                            <li><b>Rental Service/E-Shop:</b> Implementing a website dedicated for the renting of a product can minimize the production of excessive products, and correspondingly, the use of those extra resources. They can also make certain products accessible to a wider public. This could be more realistically implemented through the Re-use of products through rental services such as subscription services and leasing.</li>

                                            <li><b>Gather Requirements.</b> Prototyping allows us to experiment and spot bugs early on in the process. This quantifies how our product would be used, and how each change would impact the end-result. Due to this we can also easily change direction if we find that we have too many features or the design is not user-friendly. During the prototype model, we’re constantly kept updated throughout the process, and our feedback, as a team, is continually incorporated. This can lead to a better overall result for end users.</li>

                                        <b>Our initial Idea:</b> The microphone captures noise from an instrument and this noise is converted to an electrical impulse and then compared to ideal frequencies of musical notes and then using the blue, red, yellow, and green LED lights, the device displays visual and verbal feedback of how close the note played on the instrument is to the ideal frequency. The speaker plays a chime when a frequency matching that of a musical note is played and volume can be adjusted with the potentiometer. The default setting with none of the buttons pressed is that the device compares what is being played to the closest ideal note and then lights that corresponding light, but with one of the buttons pressed the device only compares what is being played to the note corresponding to the button pressed as seen from the top view.<br>

                                        I think the biggest cut-down that we had to implement to our tuner device was removing the idea of implementing a musical-note selection, with this deletion we also had to narrow down our feedback notes to only be the open-notes on a guitar. This was because we thought it would be much more elegant if we just used a 7 segment display to show which musical note was currently played instead of leds lighting up differently for different ranges. Additionally, each musical note alphabet ranged in overlapping frequency ranges, so we would have needed to use a lot of storage to exactly store the frequencies of all frequencies that are possible for a single musical note, like A, which the AVR couldn’t handle.Furthermore, we also had to remove the verbal feedback, mainly because the AVR didn't have enough SRAM on board for us to store our desired audio file. Additionally, attaching an SSD card would have taken a  very long time to learn how to do, as it would have required us to learn about serial communication protocols from scratch. <br>
                                        
                                        Lastly, we also adjusted our algorithm for measuring the input frequency, as we initially began by thinking of implementing a sampling algorithm where we would gather a sufficient amount of conversions of data samples in a specific amount of time, and then we would run through the samples to see how many cycles occurred within that given time period. However, we better adjusted this to make our algorithm analyze in  real-time by counting the number of cycles immediately after each conversion sample data was available. This adjustment improved our algorithm's response-time and was more accurate, as we could run through more data samples per second to determine our frequency for our input frequency. <br> <br>
                                        
                                        <font size="+2"><b><em>My Biggest Takeaway</em></b></font><br>
                                        I really began to improve my <b>prioritization skills</b> in this project. With all the deliverables from one sprint to another, I had to manage my time and my plans in the most efficient way possible. I did this by allocating and delegating the tasks to the best-fitted group-members for the tasks. For example, when allocating the 3D-CAD design of our casing we choose the person with the most experience in solid-works to accomplish this job so as to not increase our tasks and assign it to a member who still has to brush-up or even learn CAD from scratch. Of course, prioritization is a necessary and fundamental skill to have as an engineer, especially when the workload gets heavier than usual at times. I am sure that I will need this eskill in making sure that deadlines are still met while also submitting my best work. For example, next year, I will be taking at least 5 courses per semester, doing extracurriculars, while also having to handle the pressures of finding, applying and preparing for job applications. With all of these tasks, prioritization will be my best friend and asset.

                                        Consistently looking at our product, and not seeing how innovative or “world-changing” it is, always dampened our spirits and our motivation to make it exceptional. However, realistically, how innovative could a group of second year students really make their product, on top of 4 other extensive courses, extracurriculars, and even personal manners outside of school. So, whenever we felt discouraged by how much of an impact we are really making in the world, we tried to ground our vision and began to think of the long-term effects rather than the daily impacts.<br>
                                        Thankfully, my entire group was always able to attend in-person meetings, after the shift back to in-person of course, which not a lot of the other teams were fortunate to manage. This provided us with a communal support system, where we were continuously attempting to provide critical and creative ideas to enhance and grow our product. Seeing our product move from the brainstorming phase to the multiple prototypes ignited our spirits to follow-through day after day.<br><br>

                                            <li><b>Good Communication Skills among Team Members:</b> Suppose there are five members in a team and all of them just follow their leader or senior. But there should also be freedom of expressing your thoughts and views, a team does not mean just following the orders but they should also be free to express their thoughts and ideas. This makes a good team and all of the members feel that they are really important and they perform in a very good way. Through our project the scrum master did not have authority over team members, however, they did have authority over the process.</li>
                                            <li><b>Reducing Conflict:</b> A team should not be filled with opposite thoughts and full of conflicts, this will never allow a team to work. So, there should be a scrum master and all of the team members should strictly obey his decision regarding the design-process. It is the duty of the scrum master to make smart decisions to avoid any kind of conflict among the team members, while not directly having authority over team members. Through this, team members will be guided to think in the right direction, otherwise, when a team is not clear it cannot produce new ideas and ways to complete their task. </li>
                                            <li><b>Keep Your Ego Aside:</b> When you are working in a team you should always take care that your ego should not clash with others because everyone has some ego but they should keep it apart when they are working in a team. This is one of the basic rules of a team. Otherwise, a team cannot generate profitable ideas, since some team members will not recognize or respect other proposed ideas.</li>
                                            <li>Work Should be Assigned as per Interest and Ability: All of us have different abilities and should be given work as per interest for good results. We should keep on learning but when there is a time boundation, we should work smartly for good results.</li>
                                        </ul><br>

                                        <b>Remember to assume positive intent.</b> I wouldn’t necessarily say it was new information, but it’s always helpful to me to remember to assume the people I’m working with are operating from a place of positive intent. This is especially true when things get busy and everyone is stressed out because it’s so easy to lose your cool and assume a more adversarial relationship with your team when there are differences of opinion or approach. But after my experience with working on the ENEL 300 project I now always try to keep in mind that most people are just coming into work and trying to do the best they can. They probably aren’t trying to work against me and it’s important to take a moment to try to see things from their point of view.

                                        Islamic Relief is an international aid agency that provides humanitarian relief and development programs in over 40 countries.  I have been thoroughly involved with Islamic Relief Calgary for the past couple of years. I am part of their emergency Volunteer Team in Calgary. That means I organize, manage, and construct the fundraisers which are based in Calgary. We focus on providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people from conflicts and natural disasters, mainly directed at Muslim communities. We achieve this through fundraising/charity campaigns such as religious-conferences and other-forms of community-gatherings. Additionally, not only do I help-around with fundraisers but also with many other Muslim-community-based activities, such as Eid Gatherings and Ramadan preparations. We typically run huge fundraisers/gathering of all sorts every two-weeks, contributing a big population of the Muslim community in Calgary to help both raise money for countries in crises, like Kashmir or Palestine, and bring many of the Muslim community together in joy and learning. For example, in 2019 we organized a big concert-gathering in the Saddledome with many Muslim-influencers to help with Kashmir’s and Syria’s crises. <br><br>
                                        From this volunteering experience I have learned that most people could be compassionate or sympathetic towards people in major crises and who need major help, but not everyone acts upon their sense of sympathy. Therefore, to create change one must not just exchange emotions, but exchange actions. Additionally, working with communities to strengthen their resilience to disasters helped me understand how leaders must unite in cases like these to make a noticeable change. Without the many independent donations from Muslims in Calgary, Islamic Relief would have never had the impact it had previously, and currently has, on other Muslims in need all across the world.

                                        In grade 12, I was the president of my junior achievement business group, called Sock Shoppe, for my last two years of High School. In both years, my group sold an average of $2000 worth of product per year. We broke well over even during both years and achieved more than an average of $1350 in revenue profits per year. Throughout my two years, my friends and I created a unique business plan and executed it by making 450 dyed socks in an eight-month period. And, from my group's combined effort, we devoted 35% of our profits to the Canadian Mental Health Association. However, during the execution of this business plan, I was constantly faced with the operational difficulties and the incoordination that came along with initiating a business, but I was contrarily motivated by the vision of helping those in dire circumstances. So, I kept at it. As a president, I had to focus not only on one specific branch of the business but on all of them. However, out of all the different branches, I was mostly involved in the marketing, IT, and production sides of the operation.<br><br>
                                        In conclusion, Sock Shoppe was established with one goal in mind, which is best expressed by our company mission statement of "Reconnect Color with Calgary". The goal of our company was to spice up an often-bland clothing item and provide our customers with happiness. And so, with our initial individual investment of $30.00 each, Sock Shoppe was able to reconnect Calgary with color and provide customers with an outlet for creativity, in the form of beautiful tie-dye socks. Over the course of this program, my dedicated team of entrepreneurs were able to break even and secure a final Return on Investment of 193% after donating 35% of Profits to the Canadian Mental Health Association, and 25% to the Junior-Achievement Association which had Helped mentor our vision. I learned many leadership lessons during this program, but the most important one was how to deal with adversity when it appears unexpectedly. Throughout our journey, we faced many setbacks in marketing, production, and IT, with limited resources to resolve any of them. However, through our creative and optimistic perspective, we managed to exceed any expectations and managed to surpass all our adversities. The company program has been a truly transformative experience, every single member of my team grew immensely, and it was truly amazing to witness the personal development of each and every member of the board of shareholders, my friends.
